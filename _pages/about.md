I am a second-year PhD student at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, conducting my research in collaboration with Peng Cheng Laboratory. My PhD supervision is provided by Prof. Hezhenyu from the School of Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, and Prof. Guiweihua from Peng Cheng Laboratory. In addition to my studies, I also serve as a research scientist at PCL in Shenzhen, focusing on emerging technologies such as the metaverse, 3D generation, AI avatars, and VR/AR/MR.

I earned my master's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, under the guidance of Prof. Lijinhui and Prof. Hezhenyu. My research interests are centered around the metaverse, 3D vision, AI avatars, and VR/AR/MR technologies. I have contributed to over five papers and patents presented at top international AI conferences sponsored by IEEE.

Dedicated to advancing immersive and interactive digital technologies, I am always open to academic exchange and collaboration. Feel free to contact me anytime for potential opportunities or discussions in these fields.
