This teaching experience focused on the practical application of VR in the experimental teaching of new engineering disciplines at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen in May 2020. The workshop was designed to explore innovative approaches for enhancing the learning experience through the integration of virtual reality technology. 


Background:
======
This teaching experience emerged within the framework of the experimental teaching of new engineering disciplines at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen in May 2020. The goal was to tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by the evolving educational landscape and the demand for innovative teaching approaches.


Research Approach:
======
The workshop was devised with the purpose of investigating how the integration of virtual reality technology could enhance the learning experience. The emphasis was placed on creating immersive and interactive settings that would facilitate a profound understanding of the subject matter and stimulate students' creativity and interest.

Application:
======
In practice, students were able to participate in virtual environments, offering a hands-on learning method. This application not only enhanced their comprehension of complex concepts but also provided educators with novel means to evaluate student performance and offer real-time feedback. The utilization of VR holds the potential for broader adoption and continuous refinement in educational institutions.
